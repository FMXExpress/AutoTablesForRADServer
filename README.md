Automate REST API Development With Auto Tables For RAD Server

# Product Overview
Auto Tables is an automatic low code REST API generator for RAD Server. The server and clients can be compiled in Embarcadero Delphi. The easy to use interface allows for the quick automatic configuration of a REST server with dynamic endpoints providing read, write, and delete access to your data. Database tables can be made available with enterprise permissions for over 30 different databases including databases such as MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and InterBase. Additionally, you can automatically generate endpoints for over 80 more data sources using the Embarcadero Enterprise Connectors.
A graphical Auto Tables for RAD Server Endpoint Editor is provided to help you set up, create, and edit your Auto Tables for RAD Server endpoints. Once you configure your endpoints you can either generate a new RAD Server project or you can save them out for loading into an existing Auto Tables for RAD Server ResourceModule. The configuration format is the standard FireDAC JSON.
Full source code for the Auto Tables RAD Server ResourceModule is provided so you control your REST API server. This gives you the freedom to enhance and modify the source code as needed for your own solutions.

AutoTables for RAD Server outputs a Delphi RAD Server project, a Delphi REST client project, a Delphi REST SDK, and an OpenAPI 3.0 api spec file.

The OpenAPI 3.0 api spec file allows you to generate clients for your REST API in the following languages:
ActionScript, Ada, Apex, Bash, C#, C++, Clojure, Dart, Elixir, Elm, Eiffel, Erlang, Go, Groovy, Haskell, Java, Kotlin, Lua, Node.js, Objective-C, Perl, PHP, PowerShell, Python, R, Ruby, Rust, Scala, Swift, Typescript
